## Hi there, I'm Helmi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a programmer and currently studying at Hive Helsinki. My focus right now is C and C++ but I have some experience also in Python and Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things. I also have a Bachelor's degree in performing arts and I always approach things with a creative approach.

I like problem solving and I have always been interested in how things work and creating things from scratch. At the moment Iâ€™m learning audio programming and dreaming about working with sound in the future.

Thanks for stopping by! <3
